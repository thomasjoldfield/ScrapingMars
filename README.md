# ScrapingMars
<pre>Project for coding bootcamp class using the following tools:
  -Python-based web scraping 
  -"splinter" library for chrome browser interaction
  -"beautifulsoup" library for html traversal and data collection  
  -"flask" library for MongoDB read/write and app front end

Exploring this repo:
  -app.py contains the central code that makes it work
  -scrape_mars.py defines the core functions used in the app
  -templates folder contains the html framework for the front end
